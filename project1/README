to compile the program:
    node . url portnumber username
If an unsuccesful connection is made the client will display the error message recieved. If the error is an invalid username the user can
simply enter a username in the text box and the client will attempt to reconnect. Note there is a graphical bug that does not update the client 
upon succesful connection after a failed connection event.

The username and who am i features are taken care of automatically with the user list side bar, which auto populates the list when clients enter and 
leave the server as well as pinging the server on a set interval.

Direct messaging is acomplished by the @ symbol preceeding any name from the userlist followed by the message you wish to send an example is:
    @username hello!
Direct messaging contains an additional feature where all direct messages will appear in a seperate message box from the main chat client. This box 
will automatically open when a direct message is sent and remain open until the command '!esc' is entered which will hide the box but not delete 
the direct messages.

exiting the server can be accomplished by hitting esc two times.
